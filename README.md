# Terraform AWS Cognito Module

[![License: MPL 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MPL%202.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-2.0)

This Terraform module provides a comprehensive, flexible, and production-ready implementation of [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/). It aims to simplify user pool and identity pool setup with a single unified interface, addressing gaps found in other Cognito modules by offering extended configuration and control over almost all Cognito features.

## Prerequisites and Providers

| Description   | Name      | Version     |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| Prerequisite  | Terraform | `>= 1.6.6`  |
| Provider      | aws       | `>= 5.31.0` |


## Why This Module?

While several Terraform modules for AWS Cognito exist, many are either overly opinionated, too limited in scope, or lack important customization options. This module is built from the ground up to support:

- Full control over **User Pools**, **Identity Pools**, and **App Clients**
- Fine-grained configuration for **Lambda triggers**, **MFA**, **email verification**, and **domain settings**
- Support for all optional features like **user pool groups**, **resource servers**, **identity providers**, and **IAM roles**
- Aimed at **production use-cases** with security, customization, and clarity in mind
- Clean outputs and structured inputs
- Follows Terraform best practices for readability and reusability


## Usage

```hcl
module "cognito" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/your-username/terraform-aws-cognito.git?ref=v1.0.0"

  # Example inputs
  name = "my-app"

  user_pool_config = {
    mfa_configuration = "ON"
    lambda_config = {
      pre_sign_up = aws_lambda_function.pre_sign_up.arn
    }
  }

  app_clients = [
    {
      name                         = "web-client"
      generate_secret              = false
      prevent_user_existence_errors = "ENABLED"
    }
  ]

  identity_pool_config = {
    allow_unauthenticated_identities = false
  }
}
```
